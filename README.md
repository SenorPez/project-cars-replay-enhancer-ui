# Project Retired

In the beginning it was envisoned that the [Project CARS Replay Enhancer](https://github.com/SenorPez/project-cars-replay-enhancer/) would be a script, and the Project CARS Replay Enhancer UI would be a front-end to that script.

As time went on, however, it became more and more clear that, due to the length and complexity of the configuration files used by the Project CARS Replay Enhancer, maintaining a script to generate those was not a practical endeavor. If you're inclined to use the Project CARS Replay Enhancer completely from the command line (which can be done), it's probably easier for you to just write the JSON, instead of suffering through a seemingly endless series of command line prompts.

Because of this, the Project CARS Replay Enhancer UI became less an optional front-end to the script, and more a manditory Configuration Editor, with the option to launch the script and create videos from that front-end.

Because of this, the Project CARS Replay Enhancer UI has been merged into the main Project CARS Replay Enhancer project.

So head on over to [https://github.com/SenorPez/project-cars-replay-enhancer/](https://github.com/SenorPez/project-cars-replay-enhancer/) and continue supporting the project there, and only there.
